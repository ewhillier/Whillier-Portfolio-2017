				<h2 class="landAppearCompany">Parker's Real Maple</h2>
				<h3 class="landAppearSummary">Ever seen a maple product label without a rustic bucket or vintage photo of maple trees? Now you have, and it’s about time. Parker’s Maple understood that to stand out in this tapped market, they needed to ditch the sticky past and say hello to a clean future.</h3>
				<p class="project-details landAppearDetails"><span class="category">Role:</span> Concept & Visual Design Lead</p>

				<p class="project-details landAppearDetails"><span class="category">Illustrator:</span> Raymond Holling</p>
				<p class="landAppearDetails">My second project as an intern at Catapult, Parker’s Real Maple was a true test of my inner Canadian. The designs pictured at the left are an evolution of my original concept, picked by the client from a pool of eight designs and four designers.
	These modern label designs position Parker’s Real Maple as unique, bringing to life the story of an 11 year old who turned his hobby into a successful business at just 18 years old. This identity and package designs were featured in Joshua Parker’s presentation and product display on this season’s Shark Tank [episode no.5]. Parker’s products have now been picked up in several national retail and warehouse accounts.</p>
