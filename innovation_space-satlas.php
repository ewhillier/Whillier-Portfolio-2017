				<h1>Connect Your World</h1>
				<h2>Honeywell</h2>
				<h3>In a world where our neighbors are not just next door, but across the globe, our communication infrastructure must be reliable and always accessible. Approximately 18 natural disasters occur globally, amounting to $1.5 billion in damages per disaster annually. Because the future is unknown, we don’t know what disasters may breakdown communication. The only certainty is uncertainty; disasters are inevitable, and for that we’ve created Satlas.</h3>

				<p class="project-details"><span class="category">Role:</span> visual design, research, product development</p>
				<p class="project-details"><span class="category">Designed at:</span> Arizona State University for Honeywell</p>

				<p>Satlas is a versatile, communication aerostat/UAV capable of transmission and amplification of cell phone, HAM radio, surveillance, satellite, and internet signals. The UAV itself will be 55lbs (to be revised by Stephanie) maximum, and will feature a balloon above it with the maximum size of a school bus. Robust and powerful, Satlas can be deployed globally and is fit to match the challenges of not only infrastructure failures but also areas that are lack communication infrastructure. Our primary customer is disaster and humanitarian relief agencies like Fema and the Red Cross, as well as first responders. Our secondary customer will be large events like the Phoenix Open, Wimbledon, and Nascar. When the forces of nature throw us a disaster, Satlas will be there to connect your world.
