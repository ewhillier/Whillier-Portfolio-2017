				<h2 class="landAppearCompany">VCD Senior Class of 2017</h2>
				<h3 class="landAppearSummary">The culmination of four years of grueling, hard work, the VCD Matters Exhibition featured an exhibit from each student, presenting their senior thesis. As Digital Team Lead, I led a team of five in the design and development of a website to promote the show.</h3>

				<p class="project-details landAppearDetails"><span class="category">Role:</span> digital team lead</p>
				<p class="project-details landAppearDetails"><span class="category">Designed at:</span> Arizona State University with Justin McCray, Katie Ireland, Michelle Gonzalez, and Meaghan Socaciu</p>
				<p class="project-details landAppearDetails"><span class="category">Work:</span> design, development</p>
				<p class="landAppearDetails">The Matters Exhibition website is a one page site with each click activating a new section with javascript. The theme, "Matters", is based off of a poster design by Hunter Rohrer, and the landing section animates the poster into view. A unique sorting feature allows the viewer to click on a letter in the bottom left of the screen, and the subsequent names of students grows larger to be clicked on.</p>
				<p class="landAppearDetails">Each student has their own section with hoverable images taken by Caroline Booth, and a short summary of their senior thesis.</p>
