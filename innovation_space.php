				<h1 class="landAppearTitle">Satlas: Connect Your World</h1>
				<h2 class="landAppearCompany">Honeywell</h2>
				<h3 class="landAppearSummary">In 2015, 346 natural disasters occurred globally amounting to $66.6 billion in economic damage and 98.6 million people affected. In a disaster, communication is not only essential; it saves lives. The survival rates in disaster zones drop drastically the more time it takes to organize search and rescue. Within 30 minutes of a disaster, the survival rate of those rescued is 90%. After 24 hours, the survival rate drops to 81%. After five days, the survival rate sinks to 7%. Honeywell came to Innovation Space to enlist our help in building a UAV that addresses infrastructure. On a team consisting of an engineer, business, sustainability, industrial design, and visual communication design, we tackled this goal through extensive research, innovation and impeccable teamwork.</h3>
				<p class="project-details landAppearDetails"><span class="category">Role:</span> visual design, research, product development</p>
				<p class="project-details landAppearDetails"><span class="category">Designed at:</span> Arizona State University for Honeywell</p>
				<p class="project-details landAppearDetails"><span class="category">Work:</span> interviews, research, ideation, identity design, proposal/book design, exhibit design, environmental design, UI/UX design</p>
				<p class="landAppearDetails">Satlas is a versatile, communication aerostat/UAV capable of transmission and amplification of cell phone, HAM radio, satellite, and internet signals. Robust and powerful, Satlas can be deployed globally over areas where natural disasters have taken down communication infrastructure, restoring vital communication between first responders and allowing for relief efforts to be coordinated in the limited window before survival rates plummet. When the forces of nature throw us a disaster, Satlas will be there to connect your world.</p>

				<p>Each team member was responsible for the materials in his/her respective discipline. In order to present this plethora of material, a book was designed to incorporate all deliverables. The following images are snippets of a 143 page book that details understanding the problem, product innovation, technology innovation, brand experience innovation, business innovation, and sustainability innovation.</p>

				<p>If you've made it this far, the best has been saved for last. The VCD class of 2017 hosted a graduation show comprising exhibits from each student's senior project. The following images are of the Satlas exhibit, which addresses an audience of mainly family and friends who identify with our product as potential disaster victims. The intention of the exhibit is not to sell Satlas products, as the audience is not our primary target, but to bring awareness to the reality that the future is unknown, and now is the time to seize the day.</p>
