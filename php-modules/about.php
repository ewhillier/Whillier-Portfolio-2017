				<h2>I am Eve</h2>
				<p>I am a graphic designer and front-end web developer who specializes in branding and digital design. I am a life-long learner and my current pursuit is in Biomimicry and its applications for graphic design.</p>
				<h3>For the sake of focus.</h3>
				<p>My design mantra, "For the sake of focus" is derived from a longer quote, "Minimalism is not subtraction for the sake of subtraction. Minimalism is subtraction for the sake of focus." (-unknown) It's easy to design for the purpose of arbitrarily making content pretty. I design for the purpose of honouring content by using design to enhance the focus of the message.</p>
